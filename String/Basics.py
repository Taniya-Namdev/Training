# A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. In most programming languages, strings are treated as a data type and can be manipulated using various operations.

# Concatenation :
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + " " + str2

# Substring Extraction :
str = "Hello World"
substr = str[0:5]

# Length:
str = "Hello"
length = len(str)

# Comparison :
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
is_equal = str1 ==str2
print(is_equal)

# Searching :
str = "Hello World"
position = str.find("World")
